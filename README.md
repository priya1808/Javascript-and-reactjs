# SHAPEAI Javascript and Reactjs BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 7 days free bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI. 
<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions aa well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>JavaScript
<li>React.js
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming  learn. 
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
